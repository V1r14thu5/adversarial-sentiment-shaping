Overview
This repository contains the dissertation exploring adversarial sentiment shaping—a system-level phenomenon where low-cost, well-timed linguistic interventions bias collective emotional trajectories through reinforcement and amplification, without requiring persuasion or malicious intent.

Abstract
Sentiment indicators derived from digital discourse increasingly inform institutional decision-making in finance, governance, security, and public communication. These indicators implicitly assume that aggregated sentiment reflects authentic, independently formed human attitudes. This dissertation challenges that assumption by introducing adversarial sentiment shaping: a system-level phenomenon in which strategically timed linguistic inputs bias collective emotional trajectories through reinforcement, amplification, and cognitive load effects.

Drawing on learning theory, cognitive load research, Cold War signal-amplification analogues, and declassified propaganda and risk-assessment doctrine, the dissertation argues that modern sentiment systems reproduce a recurring institutional failure mode: acting on amplified proxy signals as if they were calibrated measures of reality. The contribution is not a claim about individual belief manipulation, but a diagnosis of measurement fragility in environments where sentiment has become legible, actionable, and therefore targetable.

Core Thesis
Adversarial sentiment shaping exploits the gap between proxy signals and underlying reality. It operates through:

Reinforcement dynamics over persuasion

Repetition without belief through digital interaction patterns

Cognitive load and environmental degradation

System-level pseudo confirmation bias

AI-mediated optimization of engagement and emotional valence

Dissertation Structure
Chapter 1: Introduction: Sentiment as Signal
Institutions have always relied on proxies. This chapter introduces the central claim: contemporary digital environments enable adversarial sentiment shaping—a process by which small, strategically timed inputs can cascade into disproportionate downstream effects through reinforcement dynamics, participatory amplification, and feedback blindness.

Chapter 2: From Persuasion to Reinforcement
Examines the shift from classical persuasion models to reinforcement effects. Digital platforms dramatically reduce the cost of reinforcement mechanisms (sharing, liking, reposting), enabling sentiment shaping that biases trajectories, not minds.

Chapter 3: Learning Theory and Repetition Without Belief
Draws on Ebbinghaus' memory research and the mere exposure effect to demonstrate how digital interactions (retweeting, commenting, algorithmic resurfacing) function as recall, rehearsal, and spaced repetition—mechanisms that operate independently of belief or assent.

Chapter 4: Cognitive Load, Doomscrolling, and Environmental Degradation
Analyzes how sustained interruption, emotional arousal, and attentional fragmentation in digital environments produce epistemic degradation—reducing the reliability of signals that institutions later interpret as meaningful indicators of public sentiment.

Chapter 5: Pseudo Confirmation Bias
Introduces pseudo confirmation bias as a system-level effect where repeated, amplified, and algorithmically reinforced signals create the appearance of confirmation independent of individuals' prior beliefs or information-seeking behavior.

Chapter 6: AI as a Reinforcement Optimizer
Examines how large language models operationalize existing cognitive vulnerabilities through feedback optimization and reinforcement learning, enabling adaptive sentiment steering even without adversarial intent.

Chapter 7: Historical Analogues: Cold War Signal Amplification
Analyzes Cold War cases (missile gap, bomber gap, Able Archer 83) as illustrative analogues of institutional failure modes when acting on amplified perception despite limited empirical grounding.

Chapter 8: Propaganda, Panic, and Unwitting Amplification
Compares Soviet propaganda theory and U.S. psychological operations doctrine with modern digital environments, highlighting structural parallels in indirect reinforcement through unwitting intermediaries.

Chapter 9: Measurement Drift and Feedback Blindness
Applies Goodhart's Law to sentiment indicators: when sentiment measures become operational targets, they cease to be reliable measures. Examines drift, volatility amplification, and second-order feedback blindness.

Chapter 10: Methodological Orientation
Outlines the empirical focus on signal dynamics rather than individual belief change. The unit of analysis is the trajectory, not the individual.

Chapter 11: Scope, Ethics, and Limitations
Explicitly excludes clinical mental health claims, neurological mechanisms, attribution of malicious intent, and content regulation proposals. The ethical concern is measurement integrity, not speech control.

Chapter 12: Institutional Implications
Argues that institutions trade fidelity for speed in sentiment systems, creating vulnerabilities to compressed decision timelines and overreaction to noise. Proposes measurement governance rather than censorship as the appropriate response.

Chapter 13: Conclusion: Epistemic Fragility in an AI-Mediated World
Synthesizes the central risk: epistemic fragility, where institutions mistake amplified sentiment for calibrated signal in an AI-mediated environment.

Key Contributions
Theoretical: Formalizes adversarial sentiment shaping as a distinct phenomenon from persuasion

Conceptual: Introduces pseudo confirmation bias as an environmental, rather than cognitive, effect

Historical: Identifies recurring institutional failure modes in proxy signal interpretation

Practical: Diagnoses measurement fragility in AI-mediated sentiment systems

Novel Concepts
Adversarial Sentiment Shaping: Strategic manipulation of collective emotional trajectories through reinforcement dynamics

Pseudo Confirmation Bias: System-generated appearance of consensus through amplification and repetition

Epistemic Degradation: Reduced signal reliability under conditions of cognitive load and emotional arousal

Reinforcement Without Belief: Propagation mechanisms (repetition, rehearsal) that operate independently of endorsement

Methodology
Unit of analysis: Sentiment trajectories and signal dynamics

Analytical focus: Time-series distortion, reinforcement curves, amplification asymmetry, sentiment persistence, network diffusion

Interdisciplinary synthesis: Learning theory, cognitive science, historical case studies, AI research, declassified documents

Ethical Position
This work explicitly:

Excludes clinical mental health claims, neurological mechanisms, or content regulation proposals

Focuses on measurement integrity and institutional decision-making processes

Advocates for measurement governance and robustness checks, not speech control or censorship

Implications
For institutions relying on sentiment indicators:

Recognizes the trade-off between speed and fidelity in sentiment systems

Warns against compressed decision timelines and overreaction to amplified noise

Suggests incorporating latency, feedback-loop awareness, and robustness protocols
