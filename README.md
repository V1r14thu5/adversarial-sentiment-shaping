## Abstract
This doctoral dissertation investigates a critical vulnerability in modern decision-making systems: **adversarial sentiment shaping**. As institutions in finance, governance, and security increasingly rely on AI-driven sentiment indicators, this research argues these metrics are not passive reflections of public opinion but are actively targetable signals.

The core thesis posits that low-cost, strategically timed linguistic interventions can disproportionately bias collective emotional trajectories. This occurs not through traditional persuasion, but by exploiting **reinforcement dynamics**, **cognitive load**, and **participatory amplification** inherent to digital platforms. The result is **epistemic fragility**, where institutions risk acting on amplified proxy signals as if they were calibrated measures of reality.

## Core Concepts
*   **Adversarial Sentiment Shaping:** The system-level phenomenon where sentiment indicators, once made legible and actionable, become targets for manipulation that bias emotional trajectories.
*   **From Persuasion to Reinforcement:** Shifts the focus from changing beliefs (persuasion) to steering pre-existing orientations through low-friction digital repetition (reinforcement).
*   **Goodhart's Law for Emotions:** Applies the economic principle—"when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"—to sentiment analysis, illustrating its inherent corruptibility.
*   **Pseudo-Confirmation Bias:** A system-level effect where algorithmically reinforced signals create the *appearance* of consensus or trend confirmation, independent of individual belief.
*   **AI as a Reinforcement Optimizer:** Positions Large Language Models (LLMs) not as malicious actors, but as systems that inherently operationalize and scale these vulnerabilities through engagement optimization.

## Why It Matters: Real-World Implications
This framework explains systemic vulnerabilities in:
*   **Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets:** Markets driven by "social sentiment" and narrative are acutely vulnerable to coordinated shaping, where influencing the perceived "vibe" can trigger volatile algorithmic and herd-driven trading.
*   **Political & Governance Dashboards:** Real-time public mood metrics can create feedback loops, compressing decision timelines and elevating noise to the level of crisis.
*   **Corporate & Brand Risk:** "Social listening" dashboards used for crisis response can be weaponized to force organizations into premature or disproportionate reactions.
