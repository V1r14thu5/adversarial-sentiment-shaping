## Abstract

This dissertation investigates a critical vulnerability in modern decision-making systems: **adversarial sentiment shaping**. As institutions in finance, governance, and security increasingly rely on AI-driven sentiment indicators, this research argues these metrics are not passive reflections of public opinion but are actively targetable signals. The core thesis posits that low-cost, strategically timed linguistic interventions can disproportionately bias collective emotional trajectories. This occurs not through traditional persuasion, but by exploiting **reinforcement dynamics**, **cognitive load**, and **participatory amplification** inherent to digital platforms. The result is **epistemic fragility**, where institutions risk acting on amplified proxy signals as if they were calibrated measures of reality.

## 1. Introduction

The digitisation of public discourse has precipitated a parallel revolution in its measurement. "Sentiment" – once the domain of qualitative analysis – is now quantified, tracked in real-time, and integrated into high-stakes decision dashboards across finance, governance, and corporate strategy. This dissertation posits that this operationalisation creates a novel and systemic vulnerability. By making collective emotion legible and actionable, we have not merely created a new class of indicator; we have created a new class of **target**.

The central argument is that the architecture of digital platforms, combined with the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), creates conditions ripe for **adversarial sentiment shaping**. This is not the blunt instrument of historical propaganda, but a subtle, scalable, and epistemically corrosive practice. It exploits algorithmic reinforcement, human cognitive biases, and the participatory nature of social media to steer emotional trajectories with minimal input, creating a dangerous divergence between measured sentiment and underlying reality.

This work aims to provide a diagnostic framework for this vulnerability, tracing its mechanisms, illustrating its real-world impacts, and outlining the contours of epistemic fragility it induces.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1. The Rise of Sentiment as a Metric
Tracing the evolution of sentiment analysis from early linguistic analysis to contemporary AI-driven analytics, and its adoption as a key performance indicator (KPI) in non-traditional domains.

### 2.2. Goodhart's Law and Metric Corruption
Examining the economic sociology of measurement, focusing on Goodhart's Law and its applicability to non-financial metrics, particularly socio-emotional measures.

### 2.3. Reinforcement Dynamics in Digital Networks
Synthesising research on algorithmic curation, engagement optimisation, and the psychology of repetition, which form the behavioural substrate for shaping operations.

### 2.4. Epistemic Vulnerability in Complex Systems
Drawing from philosophy of science and organisational theory to understand how institutions become fragile when their models of the world are passively corrupted by adversarial interference.

## 3. Theoretical Framework

### 3.1. Defining Adversarial Sentiment Shaping
A system-level phenomenon where sentiment indicators, once made legible and actionable, become targets for manipulation designed to bias collective emotional trajectories and, by extension, the decisions that rely on them.

### 3.2. From Persuasion to Reinforcement
A paradigm shift: the objective is not to change deep-seated beliefs (a high-cost endeavour), but to amplify and steer pre-existing orientations through low-friction, algorithmically boosted digital repetition.

### 3.3. The Pseudo-Confirmation Feedback Loop
A system-level cognitive bias where the mere volume and visibility of a sentiment signal, reinforced by platform mechanics, create the illusory *appearance* of consensus or trend confirmation, irrespective of its ground truth.

### 3.4. AI as a Reinforcement Optimiser
LLMs are positioned not as autonomous malicious actors, but as powerful tools that inherently operationalise and scale these vulnerabilities. They generate engaging, platform-optimised content that systematically tests for and exploits reinforcement pathways.

## 4. Methodology

This research employs a multi-method approach:
- **Conceptual Analysis:** To construct the core theoretical framework.
- **Comparative Case Studies:** To ground the theory in empirical domains (finance, politics, corporate strategy).
- **Digital Ethnography:** To observe the mechanics of sentiment shaping in vivo on selected platforms.
- **Signal Tracing:** To analyse the lifespan and amplification of specific narrative elements.

## 5. Analysis & Case Studies

### 5.1. Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets
Markets explicitly driven by "social sentiment" and narrative are analysed as prime environments for adversarial shaping. Case studies examine how coordinated activity influences the perceived "vibe," triggering volatile algorithmic and herd-driven trading responses.

### 5.2. Political & Governance Dashboards
The integration of real-time public mood metrics into political decision-making suites is explored. Analysis focuses on how these dashboards can create artificial feedback loops, compressing decision timelines and elevating noise to the level of perceived crisis.

### 5.3. Corporate & Brand Risk
The use of "social listening" dashboards for crisis response is investigated. Evidence suggests these tools can be weaponised by bad actors to fabricate the perception of a crisis, forcing organisations into premature, disproportionate, or strategically damaging public reactions.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1. Implications for Institutional Trust
The erosion of epistemic confidence when key decision-inputs are passively corruptible. Discusses the potential for systemic cynicism and institutional paralysis.

### 6.2. Towards Resilient Measurement
Proposes principles for more robust sentiment-informed decision-making, including epistemological humility, signal triangulation, and the development of "antifragile" metrics less prone to adversarial optimisation.

### 6.3. Limitations of the Study
Acknowledges the challenges of attributing specific outcomes to shaping activity, the rapidly evolving capabilities of AI, and the domain-specific nature of the case studies.

## 7. Conclusion

This dissertation has argued that **adversarial sentiment shaping** represents a profound and underappreciated vulnerability in digitally mediated societies. By leveraging the reinforcement architecture of platforms and the scalable content generation of AI, actors can induce **epistemic fragility**—a state where institutions confidently act on a distorted picture of the world.

The path forward requires moving beyond naïve faith in sentiment metrics. It demands a new literacy among decision-makers: an understanding that the map is not the territory, and that in the digital age, the map itself can be cheaply and strategically redrawn by adversaries. The task is not to abandon these tools, but to develop the conceptual and technical frameworks necessary to use them with appropriate caution and robust scepticism.
